# How to build docs

Due to the lack of complete .NET 5 and C# 9.0 support (https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/issues/6790), custom fork of DocFX must be used: https://github.com/GlebChili/docfx/tree/charp-9-workaround-by-tanner-gooding. It contains workaround by [Tanner Gooding](https://github.com/tannergooding).
